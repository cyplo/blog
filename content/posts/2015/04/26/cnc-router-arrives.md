After 2 months of waiting - my CNC router arrives. 8 weeks lead time
they said - 7 weeks and 4 days it was ! Who are they ?
[TanieCNC](http://tanie-cnc.pl/) people [CheapCNC in Polish :].
Although it may look like they don't know how to make websites AND their
name does not instill a lot of confidence - but hey, they certainly
know how to weld and make precise machinery ! The size of the package
caught me off guard, I've spent an hour disassembling the crate in full
sun. After that I wasn't able to get it through the stairs myself,
fortunately a friendly neighbour gave me their pair of hands. Lifting
the machine by 2 people is okay, it's still not lightweight, but
bearable. Putting it on the table was a different affair entirely.
Careful not to damage anything, especially the motor assemblies - we've
put it on a impromptu wood ramp. Using heavy duty straps, we've lifted it
up little by little. Then some inspection - the quality is really
superb, especially of the metal frame ! After that I got an old PC with
Windows XP and parallel port running Mach3 software - I wanted to set it
up as in any other shop at start. Later on I'm planning on moving to
LinuxCNC and then gradually off parallel port on to a USB stack,
something more like an arduino parsing gcode and driving motors instead
of relying of the accurate timing of the PC. TODOs:

- add an MDF bed layer on top of existing bed
- get better clamps
- get more router bits
- get a vacuum attachment for the spindle
- move to LinuxCNC
