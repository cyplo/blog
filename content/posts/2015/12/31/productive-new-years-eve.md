It turns out that the last day of the year can be quite productive. I've
managed to sneak in a PCB layout for the input measurement and
protection board for my [sunpowered](/series/sunpowered). Got it
ordered, can't wait to test it ! I got carried away with via stitching
there a bit - we'll see how hard it will be to solder the larger
components because of that. The whole project is hosted
[here](https://github.com/cyplo/sunpowered/tree/master/electronics) - it's
open hardware so please do take a look.
