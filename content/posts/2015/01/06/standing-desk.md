It was some time since the last photo-story so, please accept these
pictures of my standing desk. On the actual desk, there is a laptop
stand serving a role of a keyboard and mouse rest. Laptop itself is
flipped on its back, motherboard attached to the back of what once was a
lid. The whole thing is flying on standard monitor desk mount, using
custom vesa-to-acrylic mounting system ;)
