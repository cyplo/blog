I thought it would be cool to share with you the tools I find
surprisingly useful. Behold the first in the series: the PCB holder ! I
cannot overstate how much is that of a difference from the 'third
hand'-type of holders. The grip is very firm but won't scratch the
surface nor short anything because the jaws are made from a soft
plastic. And the whole thing **ROTATES** !
