This is the second part in the [series](/series/tools) on the tools I use. Tools that are
surprisingly useful, tools that are not that obvious to find. Today:
how to calibrate the CNC axis without actually cutting anything ? Use a
test indicator ! How to hold the meter steady though, ? Attach it to the
frame of your router using the power of magnets ! Sample item on Amazon
[here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OZA71H6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00OZA71H6&linkCode=as2&tag=adventucomput-20&linkId=6ZJKCJHMA2YON4LY)
[affiliate link warning]

Despite being attached to the frame by its back instead of the bottom it
still holds beautifully.
