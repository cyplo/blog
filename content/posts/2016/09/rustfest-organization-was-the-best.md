# I went to RustFest and it was amazing !

It was clearly the best conference organizational-wise I've been to so far.
It made me think of what I really liked there. What made it so awesome and welcomy ?
To me this was a large number of small things just coming together. I listing them here for me to remember and for others to use.
Let's make conferences at least this friendly, together !

## Before the event:

- very clear emails, repeating messages couple of times in different emails for the important stuff
- maps of the popular routes provided, e.g. from the airport and bus station
- supporter ticket sale - two times the price - you pay for another person that wouldn't be able to get a ticket otherwise
- survey on dietary requirements/allergies
- survey on childcare needs
- clear statement of the code of conduct for the conference

## During the event:

- very good MC person

  - keeping people entertained through the tech breaks
  - keeping tabs on the talk length, allowing appropriate amount of questions if the time allowed

- live captioning of all talks - small screen outside of the view of the main screen with the text live
- getting the next speaker prepared and mic-tested before the end of the current talk

- quiet room to rest with clear rules on no talking and interrupting there
- clear signage for the different parts of the venue (washrooms, quiet room, party space etc)
- washrooms

  - all same, ungendered
  - basic items for free in said washrooms

    - chewing gum
    - tooth paste
    - tampons, pads
    - baby wipes

- info desk/registration

  - clear info during registration, handing out programme
  - asking people if they want to be on the photos - giving out lanyards accordingly - flashy red lanyards for people who do not want photos of them taken

- emergency number to call with stated purpose

  - code of conduct violation
  - if you are lost in the city
