Hi ! Just letting you know that I've been working for some time on
structuring my dotfiles and finally published them to
[github](https://github.com/cyplo/dotfiles). These contain e.g. my
[vimrc](https://github.com/cyplo/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc) and
[font](https://github.com/cyplo/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/share/fonts)
[configs](https://github.com/cyplo/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/fontconfig/conf.d).
I've [patched](https://github.com/cyplo/vim-colors-solarized)
the famous [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme
for vim to allow better
[gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) symbols
display. Enjoy !
