I'm writing this on the beginning of the day 2 of 30C3, as day 1 was so
packed with action that I was not able to sit down and type, not even
for a little while. [Glen Greenwald's keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyA6NZ9C9pM) was
moving the crowd, making the audience interrupt him with rounds of
applause every few minutes. Lots of mobile phone network exploitation
talks along with general anti-buffer-overflow techniques. [Tor folks talking about the interesting times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJNxbpbHA-I) we live in. Quite
a day. Here are some photos, with no Congress people, except for me, in
them, as the tradition goes.
