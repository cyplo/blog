I gave a talk this Monday, an important one I think. The one from the
kind of spreadingÂ  knowledge on the safe internet usage to people not
necessarily of the tech background. This was my first one given to a
such audience and to add to it all, it was given in Polish. The biggest
challenge ? Finding good equivalent for the English tech terms. I think
the talk went quite okay and the discussion afterwards was
lively. I talked a bit on how the internet works and what's wrong with
that, to transition later to what problems Tor addresses and which it
does not. I tried to emphasize that using Tor does not make you
automatically immune to the dangers of the internet. Big thanks to the
organizers, [Praxis](http://praxis.ue.wroc.pl/) student group from
the Wroclaw University of Economy. You can find my slides
