It's not common for me to put just one link here as the content of the
article. Today, however, is one of these days. The
[bettercrypto](https://bettercrypto.org/) folks came up with
really excellent practical guide to securing your servers. A draft for
now, but already sporting a high concentration of knowledge. BTW - it
being a draft means that you should read it and contribute to it as
well.
