I find it useful to hang as much stuff as possible on the walls, instead
of using shelf/floor/desk space for that. Here is just a quick hack I
did to allow filament spools to be mounted securely to a wall. It turns
out that if you cut off the bent part the rod it fits perfectly into the
spool's handle hole.
