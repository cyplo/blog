- back to netlify, but without custom sync script - mention link to script - deploys are much faster now
- new domain
- new design
- made sure links work
- made sure tags are consistent
- removed thumbnails - generated on the fly now
- wording - guys -> folks
- easy to compose custom templates with the theme ones - see how 'series' is done in the repo
- smaller repo overall - count number of files ?
