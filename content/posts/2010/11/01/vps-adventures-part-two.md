After some not so pleasurable experiences with the previous VPS hosting
provider I started my search for some other one. This time not only
google was involved but also [aardvark](http://vark.com/) and some of
the "top XX best hosting providers" sites. Two results kept showing up.
[server4you](http://www.server4you.com/) and
[tilaa](https://www.tilaa.nl/). Which one to choose then ? I wanted
to give both of them a chance.

[server4you](http://www.server4you.com/). I really tried to buy a VPS
there and I failed. Lots of forms to fill and no instant money
transfer available. I entered my credit card details only to receive the
email after a day or so stating that they were unable to process my
payment.

[tilaa](https://www.tilaa.nl/). What caught my attention there was
that clean website of them. I like such a design style, as you can also
see it here. Not so cheap, I must admit, but definitely easy to buy.
Payment transfered and after about a minute I had a full access to the
VPS. That's how I like things to work. I am using tilaa's the most
simple VPS plan since then and I am pretty happy with it. Here gathered
are some things I like or don't about its services.

- friendly, responsive staff
- 2x RAM amount of swap space - seems great compared to no swap on other VPSes
- [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)- and [qemu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU)-based, you get full control of your system
- good overall system responsiveness - I experienced occasional lags when using [OpenVZ](http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page) virtualization before, there's no such thing here
- they work fast - the day the new Ubuntu 10.10 was released, they had the VPS image ready !
- their motto "We try to be good open source citizens" just convinces me
- the only disadvantage is the price, it's 8.95 euro net montly, it's also easy to miss that info on the site

As I already have a safe place to tinker with my system the real work on
the server configuration begins. Stay tuned for the next episode.
