- [legdur](https://sr.ht/~cyplo/legdur/) - legdur is a simple CLI program to compute hashes of large sets of files in large directory structures and compare them with a previous snapshot. Think having your photo collection you acquired over time and worrying about bitrot.
- [genpass](https://sr.ht/~cyplo/genpass/) - A simple yet robust commandline random password generator written in Rust. Has an extensive generative test suite, including tests against a Rust port of Dropbox's password strength tester zxcvbn.
- [netlify deployer](https://pypi.org/project/netlify-deployer/) - A Python CLI tool to deploy a website to Netlify using their incremental API client. Not the best code but works like a charm. This blog [uses](https://git.sr.ht/~cyplo/blog/tree/master/item/.build.yml#L21) it.
- [my dotfiles](https://sr.ht/~cyplo/dotfiles/) - all of the settings for all of my machines, automated using Nix
- [bakare](https://sr.ht/~cyplo/bakare/) - work in progress on writing a modern backup solution in Rust
