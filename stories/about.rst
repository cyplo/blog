Hi ! I'm Cyryl. I program stuff for a living and do much more for fun.
This blog is a kind of a notebook. Shareable notebook ? For me to not
forget how I did stuff. And to help you with your adventures. For more
of my day-job-related activities please see my
`resume <https://github.com/cyplo/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf>`__.
(You can click on the 'raw' button to download it.) About doing things
for fun. I like having fun. Unfortunately, I'm having fun most of the
time. For example, I like bicycles, you know, those that you actually
need to get moving with your legs. I enjoy taking my bike apart and
assembling it again with slightly different config. That seems to be the
theme here, by the way. I like tweaking things. I oftentimes break
stuff. I void warranties. I fix things and make them simpler. I like
things to be simple and clean. I understand, though, that it does not
mean that the road to clean is simple. I like vim. Want to chat ? Ask
about stuff on this blog or myself ? Just write to blog@cyplo.net and
I'll try to reply. Yup. A mailto link. It means that I don't fear spam.
Most of it gets filtered by my email server. The rest is fun to read !
